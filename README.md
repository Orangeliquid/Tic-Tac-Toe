# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does.

## Features

1. **Player vs Bot:**
   - Play against a computer opponent that makes random moves.

2. **Player vs Player:**
   - Challenge a friend and take turns making moves.

3. **Dynamic Game Board:**
   - The game board is displayed after each move, allowing players to see the current state of the game.

4. **Initiative Randomization:**
   - The player who goes first is randomly determined at the start of each game.

5. **Play Again Option:**
   - After a game ends, players have the option to play again.

## How to Play

1. Choose the game mode: Player vs Bot or Player vs Player.
2. The game will display the initial 3x3 board with numbered spaces.
3. Players take turns making moves by entering the number of the space they want to mark.
4. The game ends when a player gets three symbols in a row or when the board is full (a tie).
5. Optionally, choose to play again after the game ends.
